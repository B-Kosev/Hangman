# Hangman
Hangman Game project for Introduction to programming, Year 1, Software engineering @ Sofia University

I worked on this project before my  OOP course, so it is more like beginner level (despite the fact that I had some OOP knowledge from high school). I used reading from files as some kind of database for the list of possible words to be guessed. There is input validation for the menu choices. The game logic is implemented with basic do...while cycle. There are options to change the number of lives and the length constraints of the word. Implemented is an intuitive console UI.
